"Since 22 November 2008, there has been 719.4 mm of rainfall and cyclonic winds up to 80km/hr in the Jaffna Peninsula causing widespread flooding. Typhoon Parma, packing gusts of 230 kilometres (145 miles) an hour, was forecast to hit rural areas in the north of the Philippines' main island of Luzon before dawn on Saturday. Output was reduced as a result of a shortage of irrigation water following a mild winter and poor management of water resources, with catastrophic impacts on agriculture in the down river regions of the AmuDarya, the Autonomous Region of Karakalpakstan and Khorizem, but particularly the former. On April 18, a second eruption occurred, resulting in a volcanic mudflow, also referred to as a lahar. Therefore, we request all our supporters and friends to please consider donating for these emergency food relief aids for flood victims. **May 12** A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck in the afternoon during our aid distribution and multiple strong aftershocks followed. The Swiss Ministry for Defence, Civil Protection and Sports is also preparing to send emergency power generators and medicine. The strongest wind force measured near the centre of Tropical Depression No. 8 was at Beaufort Scale 6 (39 to 49 kilometres per hour), with wind gusting to above Beaufort Scale 6. The main types of schemes developed by SCF are shallow wells, birkas, ponds and haffir dams (earthen dams). Relief experts on the scene say unusually heavy rains during the past two months have put up to 1.8 million children and family members at risk in parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. Despite the favourable forecast for the summer (Kharif) cropping season in monsoon rains receiving areas, preliminary meteorological forecast indicates that availability of irrigation water will decline by 55 to 65 percent during the early part of Kharif season (April to June) and 16 to 26 percent in the latter part of the season (July to September) due to the cumulative effects of low rainfall seasons, including the main monsoon season. For a second time in less than a month, DPR Korea has been affected by floods triggered by torrential rainfalls produced by Typhoon Rusa. * Reduced mortality and morbidity among women, adolescents and children due to post-flood outbreak of communicable and infectious diseases. The Miyagi government said the series of major quakes had caused damage estimated at least 120 million yen (one million dollars) to the farming and fisheries industries in the area. However, there is normally a risk of late season pests such as quelea birds, sweet potato butterfly, stem-borers, African bollworm, stem rust, Welo bush cricket (affecting wheat, barley and teff), shoot-fly (affecting teff) and even locust at the end of the kiremt rains and before the main harvest. The Board approved assistance grants to five Muslim Communities in non member countries in India, USA, Malawi, Mauritius and Russia, in addition to educational grants to Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Somalia. Among the 19 provinces affected by the three weeks of storms, were the badly-hit southern Chinese provinces of Hunan and Guizhou, more famed for their chilli peppers and subtropical climate than for heavy snow. In the Broghal and Yarkhoon valleys of Chitral District (Northern Areas), some 4000 vulnerable persons are completely cut off and isolated as a result of continuous snowfall since December 2004. WHO recommends that the Government take immediate action to reduce the risk of dengue transmission and mitigate the impact of the dengue epidemic. Compared to 2003 when 60,000 people were affected, the 2004 floods has had less impact on the flood prone areas compared to previous years for several reasons; in Central Kenya, there was less rain on the Aberdare Mountains which usually overflows the dams and causes severe flooding downstream. Several small aftershocks have been registered since the quake, and information received indicate there might be further strong quakes because of the massive tectonic plate movements on 26 December. Due to rains floods and landslides have caused disruption to major road communication network in Lohit, Yingkiong, Changlang, Seppa, Anini, Roing & Along district. ""The findings attributed the poor harvest to unpredictable rainfall patterns as the rains which were less than normal and sparsely distributed started late and ended early,"" she noted. The worst flooding to hit the state in nearly 50 years followed catastrophic monsoon rains in northern and northeastern India, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh that killed hundreds and left millions homeless.
