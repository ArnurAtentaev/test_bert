The Jakarta Post , Jakarta | Thu, 01/15/2009 7:21 AM | Headlines - Heavy sporadic downpours over the past two days have caused a number of rivers in the city to break their banks, and have swamped hundreds of homes and forced at least 814 residents to evacuate to temporary shelters. In New Orleans, the levees broke in part because no one conceived of storm surges as savage and sustained as those hurled ashore by Hurricane Katrina. In response to this horrific disaster, Direct Relief is providing both material and financial assistance to in-country social service organizations, as well as U.S.-based and international nonprofits, working to provide medical services to tsunami survivors, prevent outbreaks of disease, and rebuild the severely damaged healthcare infrastructure of Aceh Province. On December 26, 2004, an undersea earthquake struck the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggering a series of deadly tsunamis. In Herat, WHO has received reports from Shor Village of Gulran District that claimed that 16 persons have so far died due to an undiagnosed disease. They have begun work on rehabilitating the water system and building latrines. The number of the injured and the missing stood at 374,176 and 18,379 respectively after the 8.0-magnitude quake jolted southwestern Sichuan Province and neighboring regions on May 12. MADRID, March 18 (Reuters) - International humanitarian groups are finding pockets of suffering in northern Japan, but say most victims of the earthquake, tsunami, and snow blizzards are keeping warm and getting food, water and medical attention. In the context of providing assistance to people living in emergency evacuation areas and people rebuilding their homes, in addition to the role of the government, volunteers from the community will also have an extremely important part to play. * Due to deep inundation, equipment, switchboards, and electric sources were destroyed. When a cyclone hits people are forced to move out to community shelters or to relatives' homes, bringing with them only vital items such as blankets and food. The report analyses five situations affecting livelihoods: (1) high variations in cereal production; (2) deterioration in grazing conditions; (3) depressed production of cash crops; (4) market access and (5) food price changes. Official quake toll stands at 14,500. Tearfund partner PCAR has helped Mark by training him on how to produce organic compost using cow and goat waste, which means that he doesn't have to rely on the river flooding to have good quality soil. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze, China's longest river, will likely experience another flood peak Tuesday afternoon amid heavy rain in its upper reaches. In some areas, whole villages were covered in mudslides, officials said. At least 12 civilians were killed and two wounded in separate landmine blasts during the past two weeks, news reports said at the weekend. -- As of Saturday noon, 178 aftershocks measuring above 4 on the Richter scale had been monitored in Sichuan and among them, 27aftershocks measured above magnitude 5, and four above magnitude 6. The rains caused localized flooding in several eastern provinces and counties, in particular in the lower plains, near to the coast line. So you see there's lots of earthwork that needs doing . The additional financing for the Sindh On-Farm Water Management Project aims to improve the efficiency, reliability, and equity of irrigation water distribution at watercourse levels and enhance agricultural productivity. The floodwaters inundated two-thirds of Dhaka, a city of some 10 million people, and three-quarters of Bangladesh. This week's capsizing is the first incident reported in 2012. The floods began in late July in the northwest after exceptionally heavy monsoon rains, expanding rivers that have since swamped eastern Punjab province and Sindh province in the south. The rescue and relief operations initiated by the people themselve suffered serious setback on Saturday evening due to heavy thunderstorm. The floods followed unusually heavy rainfalls and caused major damages and destruction in parts of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, and Armenia. It says, ''The trends are considerably smaller than the negative trends in the north, and could be due to a combination of increased reservoir impoundment, mis-modelled naturally varying storage and (along the southeast coast) tectonic signals related to the Dec 26, 2004 Sumatran earthquake.''. The delay in the advance of monsoon over the northeast and its stagnation along the west coast after 8 June had been primarily due to the interference of high latitude circulation features with the monsoonal flow.
